      <h1>Javascript!</h1>
      <li>An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</li><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Along with HTML an CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main things of the www (World Wide Web). It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it.</li><br>

        <li>JavaScript is single threaded. This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="jQuery-hide">

  <ul>
    <h1>jQuery!</h1>
    <li>jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License. As of May 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.</li><br>
    <ul>
      <li>jQuery was originally called JSelect.</li><br>

      <li>“jQuery” was also the name of a Java SQL library. But Resig only found out about the naming-conflict later on, after he was contacted by the project owners of the Java library.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="Py-hide">

<ul>
  <h1>Python!</h1>
  <li>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability through use of significant whitespace.</li><br>
  <ul>
    <li>According to the creator Guido Van Rossum, the name of this language was derived from the British comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". The comedy was aired on BBC during the 1970s and it gave the creator some form of entertainment during the language development. Also, Van Rossum wanted a name that was short, and mysterious. Something that will capture everyone's attention.</li><br>

    <li>This one sounds interesting right. Believe it or not, in 2015, Python overtook French to be the most popular languages that are taught in primary schools. Statistics revealed that 6 out of 10 parents preferred their children to learn Python instead of French. This just shows that many people appreciated the importance of Python programming.</li>

<div class="Ruby-hide">

<ul>
<h1>Ruby!</h1>
<li>Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection.</li><br>
<ul>
  <li>You may arise with these question. However, the answer to your question is simple. This application is user beginner friendly and learners guide. When compared to other languages, Ruby is easier in programming. It translates the programming and makes yourself free from high-pressure in programming languages.</li><br>

  <li>Day by day the popularity of Ruby on Rails os hiking. The reason for its popularity is its friendly tone. E-commerce and startups are more familiar with the frameworks. This makes the developers create the application very easily. Whatever in Ruby, it is an Object. It is for free and gets the job easily done.</li>
